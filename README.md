# Volga Infotech Project

This is a small assignment project created for Volga Infotech. It's a React application built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS using Vite.

## Introduction

This project serves as a showcase of my skills in web development. I want to express my gratitude to Volga Infotech for the opportunity to work on this assignment.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server.

## Additional Notes

- I've added personal stylings to enhance the designs and improve the user experience.
- Data is stored in the browser's localStorage to ensure it's preserved even when the page is refreshed.
- Reusable components have been created wherever possible to maintain a clean and modular codebase.
- Mobile screens have been kept in mind too.

Thank you once again for this opportunity!
